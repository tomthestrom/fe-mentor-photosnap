## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [EJS](https://ejs.co/) - EJS templating language
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - ExpressJS framework

### What I learned

I've had the chance to play with CSS grid and ExpressJS framework. It was really useful to use EJS to display the data that was coming from the mocks I put in the folder named *config*. The most challenging part was coming back to this project after over 6 weeks.
In some parts - notably the container elements for the components and some component's CSS architecture could have been done better, which I realised down the road, but I wanted to move on to the next project. :)


### Continued development

I need to get better in overall reusable component/CSS architecture, strike a good balance between reusability and cleanliness of code.

## Run the project

1. Clone the repo and `npm install`
2. Run locally by `npm run start-nodemon`
